              We are in our third decade of providing outstanding window
              cleaning and power washing services for the Central Ohio area. A
              family owned and run business based on principles that are rare in
              our time-honesty, reliability and accountability to you as a
              customer. JTS was started by Christopher Stanley and he still
              oversees the business and works hard side by side with his
              employees. He's your go-to guy to establish a great set of
              services to keep your business or home looking sparkling and

              JTS does window cleaning, power washing, and awning cleanings on
              all types of businesses from a small job for a few dollars up to
              giant clients that we work with on a regular basis. We don't work
              on a contract system with you. You have the freedom to choose who
              you work with and not be locked in. But many of our customers have
              been with us for decades, contract-free. That speaks volumes about
              how content our customers are!

              We also do residential work on all sizes of homes. We have had
              many spouses gift a home window cleaning service and earn some big
              points with their significant other, you should try it!
